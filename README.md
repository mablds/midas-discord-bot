# discord-bot
Chat-bot created to give some functionalities to my server's users. Code available to give a base about how to structure and how to use some APIs like Giphy API and Youtube API.

## Usage
You can use Midas as it is by adding it to your own Discord's server. You can do this by using [this URL](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=622482772824424458&permissions=8&scope=bot) and pasting on your browser. After this, you only need to follow the steps. (You need to be logged on your account at the discordapp website.)

Or, you can use my code to create new functionalities or delete some of them. Be free!

Pull requestes are welcome.

## Functionalities
The commands was being structured using the "!" on the beggining. There only a few ones:
* !ping - I usually do this to test the connection of my bot.
* !help - Gives some hints and instructions about how to use.
* !piada - Jokes command. Using the [kivson's API](https://github.com/kivson/charadas)
